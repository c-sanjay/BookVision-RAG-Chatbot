According to the covariance hypothesis, the adjustment applied to the synaptic weight w,, is defined by Awy = n(a; — X)(Ye ~ ¥) (2.10) where 1 is the learning-rate parameter. The average values x and y constitute presynaptic and postsynaptic thresholds, which determine the sign of synaptic modification. In particular, the covariance hypothesis allows for the following: Hebb’s hypothesis wy slope = nx; Covariance slope = n(x)-¥ Pe = 105) ypothesis Balance Postsynaptic point = 7 activity yy na, BF Maximum FIGURE 2.3 illustration of re = Hebb’s hypothesis and the covariance hypothesis."
