    "chunk_text": "Covariance hypothesis. One way of overcoming the limitation of Hebb’s hypothesis is to use the covariance hypothesis introduced in Sejnowski (1977a, b). In this hypothesis, the presynaptic and postsynaptic signals in Eq. (2.9) are replaced by the departure of presynaptic and postsynaptic signals from their respective average values over a certain time interval. Let ¥ and y denote the time-averaged values of the presynaptic signal x, and postsynaptic signal y,, respectively. According to the covariance hypothesis, the adjustment applied to the synaptic weight w,, is defined by Awy = n(a; — X)(Ye ~ ¥) (2.10) where 1 is the learning-rate parameter. The average values x and y constitute presynaptic and postsynaptic thresholds, which determine the sign of synaptic modification. In particular, the covariance hypothesis allows for the following: Hebb’s hypothesis wy slope = nx; Covariance slope = n(x)-¥ Pe = 105) ypothesis Balance Postsynaptic point = 7 activity yy na, BF Maximum FIGURE 2.3 illustration of re = Hebb’s hypothesis and the covariance hypothesis."
